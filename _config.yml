  Hi, my name's Kevin and I'm currently a 3rd year undergraduate at the National University of Singapore (NUS), pursuing a BSc (Hons) in Data Science and Analytics. I enjoy building full-stack data solutions, from processing data to creating dashboards and interfaces that turn insights into action. It's fulfilling to see these end-to-end systems make a real impact for users.
